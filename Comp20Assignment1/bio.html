	<h1>Meha Elhence Biography</h1>

		<p>I was born in Dallas, TX on January 30, 1998 to a family comprised of my mother, father, and older brother, Hirsh. I grew up surrounded by many cousins and extended family. Along with 3 of my cousins and my brother, I attended Greenhill School in Addison, TX from ages three to eighteen. Greenhill was a great community for fifteen years where I met some of my best friends and engaged in passions I still hold today. My senior year of high school at Greenhill, I applied to Tufts University. When I was accepted to Tufts Early Decision, I cried out of happiness and relief. Now, three years into my time at Tufts, I am enjoying every second of the experience. On campus, I am captain of the dance team Tufts JumboRaas, a research assistant at the DevTech Research Group, and a campus tour guide. I hope to work in the field of User Experience (UX) Design once I graduate.</p>
