# mehaelhence.github.io
Identify what aspects of the work have been correctly implemented and what have not.

I correctly implemented including all files in the repository mehaelhence.github.io of my GitHub account.
I received minimal guidance from my friend (who is a computer science major and not in this class) Victoria Tran. 
I spent approximately four hours on this assignment in total, including reading through the guidelines and course material and writing and formatting code. All of my pages passed HTML5 specifications and W3C validation checks. 

I have not yet completed: My index.html page hosted in my CS account redirects to my GitHub website.
