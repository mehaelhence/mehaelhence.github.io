# mehaelhence.github.io
I correctly implemented including all files in the repository mehaelhence.github.io of my GitHub account and redirecting to my github.io URL. 
I received minimal guidance from my friend (who is a computer science major and not in this class) Victoria Tran and help from Michael Dunkelman (TA). Michael helped me when I had trouble redirecting the CS URL to my github.io URL.
I spent approximately five hours on this assignment in total, including reading through the guidelines and course material and writing and formatting code. All of my pages passed HTML5 specifications and W3C validation checks.
